            <h1>WAYS TO PREVENT CRIME</h1> <br>
               <p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Preventing crime takes each individual person being responsible for
            their own safety and making wise choices. Those choices can include
            going out shopping at night to the landscape of your residential
            property. In the sections below, we offer a wide variety of safety tips for
            you as a person, your vehicle, your home, and your business.</p>

                <h1>Safety Tips/ Necessary tips for Self-Safety</h1>
                <h2> Car break-Ins</h2>   
               <ul style="font-size: large; padding: 0px 50px 0px 50px;">
                   <li>Removing all valuables from your car. Don't leave valuables visible</li>
                   <li>Closing the windows and locking the doors every time hile getting out</li>
                   <li>Parking in well-lighted areas and not near shrubs or fences that could possibly
                       provide concealment for criminals.</li>
                   <li>Keep your driveway and yard lit up all night. It’s harder for criminals to hide in the
                       light.</li>
                   <li> Don’t keep spare keys inside the car.</li>
                   <li>Lock your shopping packages in the trunk.</li>
                   <li>Be observant. Notify the police if you see anyone acting in a suspicious manner
                       such as loitering around cars or looking into cars.</li>
                   <li>If you sense something is odd, call the police.</li>
               </ul>
           <h2>Home Safety</h2>
           <ul style="font-size: large; padding: 0px 50px 0px 50px;">
               <li>Close and (if possible) lock all doors even when leaving for a short period of time.
                   This includes garages and connecting doors.</li>
               <li>Use automatic timers to cut lights on and off if you are gone for an extended time.</li>
               <li>Illuminate the yard, especially doorways and the rear of the house.</li>
               <li>Trim trees and shrubs around the house. These provide concealment for burglars.</li>
               <li>Install good locks on doors and windows and USE THEM. Don’t hide keys in
                   mailboxes and planters or under doormats. Instead, leave an extra set of keys with
                   a trusted neighbor or friend.</li>
               <li>Use deadbolt locks that require a key from either side (double cylinder).</li>
               <li>Be sure your street address number is large, in clear view and well-lit so police and
                   other emergency personnel can find your home quickly.</li>
               <li>Keep ladders, tools, and lawn furniture locked up. Burglars commonly use these to
                   gain entry to houses.</li>
               <li>Install a peephole or wide-angle viewer in all entry doors so you can see who is
                   outside without opening the door. Door chains break easily and don’t keep out
                   intruders.,</li>
               <li>The mere perception of alarms and dogs are the #1 and #2 barriers to burglars.</li>
               <li>Implement and be an active member of a neighborhood watch program.</li>
               <li>If you arrive home and something looks questionable (ex. a slit screen, broken
                   window, open door etc.) DON’T GO IN. Call the police immediately.</li>
               <li>Ask for photo ID from service or delivery people before letting them in. If you are
                   the least bit worried, call the company to verify.</li>
               <li>Have neighbours or family pick up letter or packages if you are going to be gone for
                   a few days.</li>
           </ul style="font-size: large; padding: 0px 50px 0px 50px;">
               <h2>Business Safety Tips</h2>
               <ul style="font-size: large; padding: 0px 50px 0px 50px;">
                   <li>Post police and emergency telephone numbers in a conspicuous location so they
                       will be readily available during an emergency.</li>
                   <li>Make sure exterior doors are locked when you or your employees leave at night.</li>
                   <li>Report any suspicious activity or persons to the police immediately.</li>
                   <li>Get the best description possible of the suspect(s) or any involved vehicle. Timely
                       reporting of this information is critical.</li>
                   <li>Consider investing in a quality surveillance system with a recording capability. This
                       may also benefit your business in regard to insurance.</li>
               </ul>
               <h2>Telephone Response Unit</h2>
               <h3 style="padding: 0px 50px 0px 50px;">When to call the Telephone Response Unit for Police assistance? </h3>
               <p style="font-size: large; padding: 0px 80px 0px 80px;">The Police Department has a Telephone Response System dedicated to taking reports by
                   telephone. You will receive the same level of service as you would if a patrol officer had
                   responded to you. To contact someone who will take your report, please call ###-###-
                   ####. An officer is available daily from *:** a.m. – *:** p.m.</p>
                   <ul style="font-size: large; padding: 0px 100px 0px 100px;">
                       <li>Missing Person (Adult / Juvenile)</li>
                       <li>Vandalism / Damage to Property</li>
                       <li>Harassing / Annoying Phone Calls</li>

                       <li>Fraud / Embezzlement / Forgeries that occurred earlier</li>
                       <li>Suspicious activity that does not require immediate police response</li>

                   </ul>
               <h2>General Crime Prevention</h2>
               <p style="font-size: large; padding: 0px 50px 0px 50px;">It is the philosophy of the Police Department that preventing crime is preferable to dealing
                   with crime after it has occurred. Crime Prevention concentrates on the dual concept of
                   eliminating or minimizing criminal opportunities, whenever possible, and encouraging
                   citizens to be responsible for their own security and the security of others.</p>
                <h3 style="padding: 0px 50px 0px 50px;">Crime Prevention Tips</h3> 
                <ul style="font-size: large; padding: 0px 100px 0px 100px;">
                    <li>Make Your Home Look Occupied: Leave some lights and a radio on when you’re
                       out.</li>
                   <li>Lock Your Doors: Never leave your house open for “just a moment,” always lock
                       your doors when you’re out.</li>
                   <li>Use Deadbolt Locks: A deadbolt lock is a good deterrent to burglars.</li>
                   <li>Don’t Hide A Key Outside: Burglars know all the secret hiding places.</li>
                   <li>Drill and Pin Your Windows: Window locks can be jimmied; pins cannot.</li>
                   <li>Brace Sliding Glass Doors: If the door is braced, the only way a burglar can get
                       through it is to break it.</li>
                   <li>Install Good Exterior Lighting: Motion sensor lights and other good lights don’t let a
                       burglar hide in the dark.</li>
                   <li>Keep Bushes and Shrubs Trimmed: If bushes are too high, someone hiding near
                       your windows and doors cannot be seen.</li>
                   <li>Stop Mail and Paper Deliveries: If you go on vacation, stop deliveries or have one of
                       your neighbors collect your mail and papers.</li>
                   <li>Get a Dog: Even a small dog may be a deterrent to a burglar.</li>
                   <li>Install an Alarm System: Houses with alarms are avoided by burglars.</li>
